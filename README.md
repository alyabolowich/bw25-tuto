# An introduction to BW25

This tutorial is [adapted from Max Koslowski's BW2 tutorial](https://github.com/maximikos/Brightway2_Intro). 

Brightway is a Python-based free and open-source software for lifecycle assessment (LCA). The official documentation can be found [here](https://docs.brightway.dev/en/latest/index.html).

LCA is a tool used for analysing the environmental (and other) pressures associated with products, technologies, and countries. Commonly, the term LCA is understood in its process-based variant where its application is bound to comparative and hotspot analysis. That is, LCAs are performed for individual products like shopping bags to figure out if a cotton-based one is more environmentally-friendly (and where along its supply chain) than a single-use plastic one, or similarly with single-use vs reusable food packaging. They may also be performed for product fleets, like on wind turbines in Denmark. The mathematics of LCA are, however, derived from the field of input-output economics which has a history dating back more than a hundred years. IO-based LCA is used for calculating environmental footprints of regions and their citizens (see for example <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-018-0113-9)" target="_blank">here</a>
 for an overview). Popular databases for process-based and IO-based LCA are, respectively, ecoinvent and EXIOBASE. The focus of Brightway has typically been process-based LCA.

This repo contains three files: a Jupyter notebook and two spreadsheets that are used at some point in that notebook.
