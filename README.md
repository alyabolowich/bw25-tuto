# An introduction to BW25

This tutorial is [adapted from Max Koslowski's BW2 tutorial](https://github.com/maximikos/Brightway2_Intro). 

Brightway is a Python-based free and open-source software for lifecycle assessment (LCA). The official documentation can be found [here](https://docs.brightway.dev/en/latest/index.html).

LCA is a tool used for analysing the environmental (and other) pressures associated with products, technologies, and countries. Commonly, the term LCA is understood in its process-based variant where its application is bound to comparative and hotspot analysis. That is, LCAs are performed for individual products like shopping bags to figure out if a cotton-based one is more environmentally-friendly (and where along its supply chain) than a single-use plastic one, or similarly with single-use vs reusable food packaging. They may also be performed for product fleets, like on wind turbines in Denmark.

This repo contains three files: a Jupyter notebook and two spreadsheets that are used at some point in that notebook.
